home brew recipes and utilities

Some ideas...

Tabs:
- Recipes
- Brew Log
- Utilities

Recipe List:
- List of recipes sortable by name or tags.
- Tap name of recipe to view details
- Add new recipe at the top
- Organize button allows delete, cancel, manage tags
- manage tags button goes to tags detail

Recipe Detail:
- Get here from Edit/Add
- Name (String)
- Source (String for name of author or url)
- Ingredients (Relationship to List of Ingredients)
- add ingredient
- remove ingredient

Ingredient:
- Name (String, new or pick from list of existing)
- Amount (number)
- Measurement (list of options like "pinch", "tsp", "cup", "oz" etc)
- Other (String like "lightly chopped" or "slighlty stinky")

Manage Ingredient Types

Manage Tags:
- Tag (String, could be anything from "Lager" to "Spicy" to "Halloween" etc)
- Tag Parents (Array, organized such as "Seasonal, style, flavors, grain, malt, hop")
- Add to Recipe ( pull up a list of existing recipes and select/deselect to create link)

What we need to capture here is that users will likely be managing and searching for many kinds of tags, 
such as beer styly, or recipes that use specific ingredients, or information on specific ingredients 
for how they will affect the recipe.
